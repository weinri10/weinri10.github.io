    <h2>Our  Mission</h2>
    <p>We  seek to establish peace across the cosmos, so that all may live in harmony! Establishing new Terran colonies on new planets, and harboring positive relations with new species are just some of the many tasks that our ranks are involved in!

        Our loyal troops also stand by to protect these new colonies from terrorist threats that seek to eradicate any life that they come across. 
        
        Our current missions involve fighting off the Arachnid scourge, as they wreak havoc on innocents and corrupt planets with their bug hives.  </p>
